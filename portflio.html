<h3>Reflective Summary: This project is a group work project which develops a math game for first and second-grade students to improve their addition and subtraction. In our group, we did it with three interaction my part is focused on developing the game design and unity coding.l have learned lots of unity 3d games development technology during this project period. And I also learned how to connect to the Django database system with the Unity system to update and keep track of data from the database The reason why I choose this project is because this is my first teamwork project which I strongly feel the power of teamwork. I have a really powerful team and every teammate has their special skills, we combine this together to deal with new stuff and problems. Finally, we have finished everything. In this project, we develop a runner game to let users choose the correct answers to the math problem and the speed of the runner change when users answer correctly or not. And the game is over, we give the final point and keep record the point to the database then teachers can keep track of their points. For dealing with problems that we give in-game, we use a random method to make math problems appear randomly also’ overall, this is a teamwork project that I have finished in Westminster College for the first time’ I feel I am actually doing things to change people’s lives and I understand the meaning of my study of computer science.</h3>

<h2>Cmpt375: Web Application</h2>
<h3>Learning Goals：To	understand	the	concepts	and	techniques	of	object-oriented software	design</h3>

<h3>Project Proposal:<a href="Client Proposal.pdf" download>Client Proposal</a></h3>
<h3>Reflective Summary: This project is also a teamwork project in my web application class. I choose this become my second project because this time my team worked with a real client from the real company’ we have a new project from park city babysitter company to help them to develop their website.lt is different from the first project, this time I am doing front-end rather than back-end. Although I am not familiar with front-end, this is a good chance to improve my front-end skills.ln this project, we are trying to re-build their whole website using HTML, CSS, and javascript and add some new functions for their website. We also need to re-build their database using firebase. The most different part than last time is that we have two designers which form communication major to work with us together, this makes me feel like I am actually working in a real IT company that have more specific roles for everyone!</h3>

<h1>3. Project(Westminster college)</h1>
<h2>Cmpt352: Computer Network</h2>
<h3>Learning Goals：To	understand	the	concepts	and	techniques	of	object-oriented software	design
</h3>
<h3>Group Member:fsckthesystem  Wenning Jiang </h3>
<h3>Project Introduction: This is a Java programm which build a basic functional chatroom.</h3>

<h3>Reflective Summary: This project is a group work project which develops a small chatroom using Java in Network class of Westminster College. There are two sections in our project, the client and the server part. We built up the server-side first and then built up the client-side separately. The most important and difficult part is to connect this two-part. We used socket technology to connect the client and the server. People can log in to the chatroom by typing their name and then start chatting in the chatroom. After that, we developed a server thread and client thread to let people can communicate in the chatroom. Finally, we add a "private chat" function to the chatroom, so people can send private messages to everyone they want in the chatroom. They can switch public and private messages easily by just typing private or public. By developing this chatroom with my partner, I have more knowledge about socket programming. It is like a final program test that put all the sock programming I learned from this class together. This helps me to understand socket programming generally and how the socket programming applies in the real world. So I have experience in socket programming and the chatroom is the most useful software which we use it very frequently in life. This makes me feel I am actually fully developing real software by ourselves.</h3>

<h1>4. Research project(Westminster college)</h1>
<h2>Cmpt335: Computer Security</h2>
<h3>Learning Goals：To	attain	a	system	level	understanding	of	the	computer</h3>
<h3>Group Member:fsckthesystem  Wenning Jiang </h3>
<h3>Project Introduction: Introduce history of major computer viruses and worms.</h3>
<h3>Reflective Summary: This is a group research project which introduces some type of computer virus in history generally and then we choose three famous computer viruses to present in detail. The three famous viruses: ILOVEYOU WORM, SQL SLAMMER WORM​, BLASTER WORM​. We also talked about the CRYPTO LOCKER/WANNACRY RANSOMWARE​ topic in this research presentation. My group start doing research online to look up the major viruses from early 1990 to 2019 and summarize it and then choose three of them to introduce deeply about the type, time, how to attack for computers and function of these three viruses. By doing this research, I learned different types of viruses and how to protect the computer safely. This is really helpful to improve my security technology.</h3>

<h1>5. Senior Capstone Project(Westminster college)</h1>
<h2>Cmpt390: Senior Capstone</h2>
<h3>Learning Goals：To	acquire	significant	project	experience	working	both	individually</h3>
<h3>Group Member: Wenning Jiang </h3>
<h3>Project Introduction: This project was focused on building a website that helps students from Indian reservations to learn and practice math online and enrich their entertainment life. Effective implementation of my web application could help students there to deal with long-distance study. The web application will allow students to practice their math skills while playing games on the website. It will serve as an alternative to the current teachers of Indian reservation who need to go to each student's home to help them. </h3>
<h3>Reflective Summary: Overall, the web application has a basic function for both teachers and students to use. The database is functioning, and features related to the database are working. The whole Unity game is embedded in the web application and worked successfully. This website is easier for students and teachers to use and it is running smoothly. The application makes sense to an average user.</h3>
